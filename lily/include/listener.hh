  Listeners

  Listeners are used for stream event dispatching.  The usual way to
  work with them is to use the GET_LISTENER macro which combines the
  basic Listener algorithm with a Callback_wrapper structure providing
  a Scheme handle into a member function.

  To register a member function of Foo as an event handler in a
  dispatcher, you must:

  - declare the function:
  class Foo
  {
    void method (SCM);
    ...
  };

  - implement the method::
  void Foo::method (SCM e)
  {
    write ("Foo hears an event!");
  }

  - Extract a listener using GET_LISTENER (Foo, method)
  - Register the method to the dispatcher using Dispatcher::register

  Example:

  Foo *foo = (...);
  Dispatcher *d = (...);
  Listener l = foo->GET_LISTENER (Foo, method);
  d->add_listener (l, ly_symbol2scm ("EventClass"));

  Whenever d hears a stream-event ev of class "EventClass",
  the implemented procedure is called.

  GET_LISTENER actually makes use of a member function
  get_listenerÂ (SCM) available in every Smob<...>-derived class.
  get_listener receives a function getting an object instance and an
  event and will turn it into a Listener that will (after turning into
  Scheme), behave as a function receiving an event as its sole
  argument, with the object instance being the object from which
  get_listener was called as a member.

  So (p->get_listener (f)).smobbed_copy () is roughly equivalent to
  (lambda (ev) (f p->self_scm() ev))

  Limitations:

  The Callback_wrapper mechanism used in GET_LISTENER works only for
  classes derived from Smob<...>.

// A listener is essentially any procedure accepting a single argument
// (namely an event).  The class Listener (or rather a smobbed_copy of
// it) behaves like such a procedure and is composed of a generic
// callback function accepting two arguments, namely a "target"
// (usually an engraver instance) and the event.  Its Scheme
// equivalent would be
//
// (define (make-listener callback target)
//   (lambda (event) (callback target event)))
//
// The class construction is lightweight: as a Simple_smob, this is
// only converted into Scheme when a smobbed_copy is created.
