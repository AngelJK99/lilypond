@subsubheading Release candidate withdrawn  @emph{June 01, 2012}

We have discovered a regression since 2.14.2, so lilypond 2.15.39
is no longer a candidate for the 2.16.0 release.  However, please
continue testing it -- we would like to discover (and fix!) any
more regressions as soon as possible.  If you discover any
problems, please send us @ref{Bug reports}.
