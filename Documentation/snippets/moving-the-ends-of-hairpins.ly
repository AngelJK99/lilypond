The ends of hairpins may be offset by setting the @code{shorten-pair}
property of the @code{Hairpin} object.  Positive values move endpoints
to the right, negative to the left.  Unlike the @code{minimum-length}
property, this property only affects the appearance of the hairpin; it
does not adjust horizontal spacing (including the position of bounding
dynamics).  This method is thus suitable for fine-tuning a hairpin
within its allotted space.
